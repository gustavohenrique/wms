An object value is a field, method or property you can get from the model
object, got from the QuerySet. There are actions to do with that field:
Value, Count, Avg, Min, Max and Sum. Default action is "Value".

    >>> ObjectValue.action == FIELD_ACTION_VALUE
    True

There are some kinds for a system field value, like the report title, the
current date/time, page number, total of pages, etc.

    >>> from geraldo import SystemField

    >>> SystemField.expression == r'%(report_title)s'
    True
